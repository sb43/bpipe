# Install Instructions

## Installation

Bpipe is entirely self contained and doesn't require any installation.   Just unzip your Bpipe download to a convenient location and place the "bin" directory in your PATH.   


## Supported Operating Systems

Bpipe is tested and maintained on:
- Linux RHEL, Centos and Ubuntu
- Mac OS X Snow Leopard or later
- Windows using Cygwin (`**`)

(`**`) Windows support may be limited in some instances due to limitations of Cygwin.

Although other Unix-like operating systems are welcome and very likely will run Bpipe without problems, you are encouraged to check bugs on one of the above OSes before asking for help.   Volunteers to maintain more operating systems are welcome!
