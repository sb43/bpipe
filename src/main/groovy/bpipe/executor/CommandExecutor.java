/**
 * Abstract class that represents a shell command to be executed
 * by Bpipe.  How the command is executed is implementation dependent.
 * <p>
 * Note: the stop() command is not implemented by the LocalCommandExecutor
 * because is not possible to reliably stop a local process job using Java.  
 * Other implementations still need to provide a "stop" command.
 * <p>
 * Implementations need to properly implement the serializable interface as 
 * Bpipe ensures recovery of state by serializing running commands to the file
 * system.  In particular, attributes that are not valid outside of 
 * the running Bpipe process should be declared transient.
